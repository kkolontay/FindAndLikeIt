In this application, I used RxSwift.frameworks Fasebook.framework. To use this application, you need to have a login in the Fasebook. After registration, you can enter the address of the destination. Next you will be offered the shortest way to travel. During the trip, you can watch the nearest 10 restaurants, by clicking on the restoran's annotation you can see the number of likes, which put Facebook customers.
During the trip, the scale of the card will change depending on the speed, if you turn off the path, you will be offered a new path.
After downloading the project from the repository, do not forget to use the command "pod install".
